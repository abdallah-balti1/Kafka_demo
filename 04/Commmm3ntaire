Here are two short, clear, professional answers in English:


---

Option 1 (concise & professional)

I added *_ so the function remains compatible when get_product_shares() returns additional columns (like isin_cd). The dependency logic only uses the first four fields, so ignoring extra values prevents unpacking errors without changing the existing behavior.


---

Option 2 (even shorter)

*_ safely ignores new columns (e.g., isin_cd) while keeping the dependency logic unchanged, and prevents tuple unpacking errors.
